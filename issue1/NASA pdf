1) Simple flow constructs. Avoid goto,setjmp/longjmp, direct/indirect recursion.
2) All loops must have fixed upper bound. Loops that have variable no of iterations 
   should have an assertion triggered whenever upper limit is exceeded.
3) Do not use Dynamic memory allocation after initialization
4) No function should be longer than 60 lines of code per function
5) Assertions: Minimum of 2 assertions should be used per function
6) Data Objects must be declared at smallest level possible.
7) Return value of non-void functions must be checked by each calling function.
8) Pre-Processor: Use of pre processor must be limited to inclusion of header files and simple macro definitions
9) Use of pointers should be restricted. function pointers are not permitted
10) All code must be compiled with warnings enabled!
