1) Indentatio: Code should be indented properly. Tab to be used in new line
2) Switch statements:Case labels should be at the same level as switch statement.
3) Spacing: space to be given after if () for () while () etc. For binary operators,
            sapce should be provided both sides. No spaces before Unary operators
4) Braces: If statement opening brace is in the same line and closing is in the same level as the for () statement.
           But this is not followed in function definitions.
           Avoid braces wherever not necessary.
5) Line Length: Code Line length should not be more than 80 characters per line.
6) Naming: Names should not be in camel case studly caps etc functions shouild have descriptive names
7) Function: Functions should not exceed 1 or 2 screens of text. 
             It should have less than 10 local variables
             should be broken into smaller functions (if it is big)
8) Commenting Style: /*
                      * (...)
                      */
9) Typedefs shhould be avoided
10) Minimize ifdefs
11) Structure Initializes: Always intialize variables. int x = 0, float x = 0.0 etc.
