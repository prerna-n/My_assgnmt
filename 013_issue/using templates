Templates are like blueprints which can be used to re-implement a code for different data types.
We implemented stack that stores integers,strings etc (assignment no 1,2) using different codes. 
To avoid re-wrting the code for different types of variables, we can simply use "templates" for writing the code structure.
Then use this template to implement integer stack or character stack. An example for the same is attached in the current issue.
